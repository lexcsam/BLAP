Predcting Bank Loan Approval using Keras Deep Learning Model

In this repository , we have multiple files - 

(1) - **Model.ipynb** ------------------> *The main file containing the generation and compilation of our Deep Neural Network model as well as training that Deep Neural Network.*

(2) - **DeployerCode.ipynb** ------------------> *The jupyter notebook file where we are deploying the trained neural network and doing prediction on unseen data.*

(3) - **UniversalBank.csv** ------------------> *The Bank CSV data from Kaggle on which we have trained our neural network model.*
