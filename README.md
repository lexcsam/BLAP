Predcting Bank Loan Approval using Keras Deep Learning Model

In this repository , we have multiple files - 

(1) - **Model.ipynb** ------------------> *The main file containing the generation and compilation of our Deep Neural Network model as well as training that Deep Neural Network.*

(2) - **DeployerCode.ipynb** ------------------> *The jupyter notebook file where we are deploying the trained neural network and doing prediction on unseen data.*

(3) - **UniversalBank.csv** ------------------> *The Bank CSV data from Kaggle on which we have trained our neural network model.*
 
(4) - **scaler_fit_data.pkl** ----------------> *Used on the training data so that we can scale the training data and also learn the scaling parameters of that data.*

(5) - **my_model(2).h5** ----------------> *In this file we stored Keras Sequential model with Weights which is been trained on our data mentioned above.*
